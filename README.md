  to CloudCard Online Photo Submission
- Outbound network access to the following domains/ports if your organization requires all outbound traffic to be
  whitelisted
    - api.onlinephotosubmission.com:443
    - s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com:443
         #### Alternate Domains
        
        - api.cloudcard.ca:443 (CloudCard's Canada instance)
        - s3-ca-central-1.amazonaws.com:443 (CloudCard's Canada instance)
        - test-api.onlinephotosubmission.com:443 (CloudCard's test instance)

To test your system, run `java -version`. The output should look like the following. The exact version isn't important
as long as it starts with `17`.
```
openjdk version "17.0.6" 2023-01-17 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Corretto-17.0.6.10.1 (build 17.0.6+10-LTS)

## Installation and Configuration

1. Create a separate [service account](https://sharptop.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/CCD/pages/1226440705/User+Roles) for
   CloudCard Photo Downloader to use. ([Instructions](https://youtu.be/_J9WKAMZOdY))
1. Download
   the [zip file](https://github.com/online-photo-submission/cloudcard-photo-downloader/raw/master/cloudcard-photo-downloader.zip).
1. Get your access token (Instructions are included in the [service account video](https://youtu.be/_J9WKAMZOdY).)
1.

Configure `application.properties` ([Instructions](https://github.com/online-photo-submission/cloudcard-photo-downloader#configuration))

1. Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to the cloudcard-photo-downloader directory.
1. Run `run` (Windows) or `./run.sh` (Linux/Mac).
1. Check the file `downloader.log` for output from the downloader.
1. *Recommended:* Set up the command to run as a service that starts automatically when the server starts. The process
   for doing this is dependent on your operating system and is outside the scope of these instructions.

## Troubleshooting

Immediately upon startup you get the following error:

    com.cloudcard.photoDownloader.ApplicationPropertiesException: The CloudCard API access token must be specified. Please update the 'application.properties' file.

1. Make sure the `application.properties` is in the same directory.
1. Make sure the `application.properties` is not named `application.properties.txt`.
1. As a workaround, You can also specify config values without an `application.properties` file using the following
   syntax
    1. `java -Dconfig.key=config.value -jar cloudcard-photo-downloader.jar`
    1. For example: `java -Dcloudcard.api.accessToken=abc123 -jar cloudcard-photo-downloader.jar`

## Configuration

The simplest way to configure the application is by creating an `application.properties` file, which should be saved in
the same directory as the downloader.
There are, however, many other strategies for configuring the application. For example you may configure the settings
using environment variables, JVM
variables, etc. See
the [Spring Boot Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-external-config.html)
for more information on those options.

    - Description: A map defining the CSV file headers and the corresponding object properties to use for their values. Values available are derived from the [Photo class](https://github.com/online-photo-submission/cloudcard-photo-downloader/blob/master/src/main/groovy/com/cloudcard/photoDownloader/Photo.groovy)
    - Default Value: `{'Cardholder_ID':'person.identifier','Photo_Status': 'status','Photo_Date_Submitted':'dateCreated'}`
        - In order to pass custom field values in, use `'person.customFields.full_custom_field_name'` (i.e. `'person.customFields.First Name'`)
        - Optional: You can specify a static field in this map by prefixing the value with `static_`.
        - Example: `'Source':'static_CloudCard'` 
        - Optional: You can specify the photo file name with the value `photo_fileName` OR the full photo file path with `photo_fullFilePath`.
        - Examples: `'Photo':'photo_fileName`, `'Photo Path':'photo_fullFilePath'`
        - NOTE: If downloading photos to multiple directories , the fullFilePath will always reference the first directory listed in `downloader.photoDirectories`.

### Encrypting application properties ([Video](https://video.drift.com/v/abZMpJLIB5O/))

-This method uses AES-256 to encrypt the run.sh file and any application properties that it contains

- note: this method only works on Linux and Mac

1. Download `encode-run-sh.sh` and `decrypt-and-execute-run-sh.sh` from the `Scripts` folder in this repository and add
   them to your downloader folder
2. Add any properties you want to encrypt (such as the access_token) to `run.sh` as command line parameters instead of
   in application.properties
3. Run `encode-run-sh.sh` and create a password
4. Delete your un-encrypted `run.sh` file
5. To run the downloader, run `decrypt-and-execute-run-sh.sh`. This will ask for your password and then execute the
   encrypted file, which runs the downloader.
